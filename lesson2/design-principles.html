        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p>Pick up Limes</p>
        <a href="https://www.pickuplimes.com/">pickuplimes.com</a>
    </div>
    <div><img id="img-1" src="pictures l2/Alignment.JPG" alt="Picture of website pickuplimes"></div>

    <p id="def-1">Pick up Limes is the best website I found to describe Alignment. As you can see, the different
        recipes offered here are completely aligned both side by side and one on top of the other. Another thing 
        that I noticed, is that they did a really good job by using a responsive website, since the smalled I made
        the screen, the more the images changed, but always keeping them aligned.
        Everything is completely aligned to these images.

        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p>Downshiftology</p>
        <a href="https://downshiftology.com/">downshiftology.com</a>
    </div>
    <div><img id="img-2" src="pictures l2/Repetition.JPG" alt="Picture of website downshiftology"></div>

   <p id="def-2">Downshiftology used repetition in this website specifically with the font. As you can see
       both on the menu, and on the title, and on the different text boxes throughout the website, she is 
       using the same font which makes it look profesional, and refined. It would be quite messy if she had 
       all different types of fonts, but she kept it simple and achieved a lot by doing so.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>Yoga With Adriene</p>
        <a href="https://yogawithadriene.com/">yogawithadriene.com</a>
    </div>
    <div><img id="img-3" src="pictures l2/Contrast.JPG" alt="Picture of website yogawithadriene"></div>

    <p id="def-3">yogawithadriene has most of the website with a white background. Many of the images have
        a soft background color, and this is the only image she used with a bold black color. You can see how 
        it contrasts really good with the rest of the website, and how it works so good. There aren't a lot 
        of colors in this website, but she did used a couple of them to contrast specially her photos and 
        content which is the most important part of her website.
